## JSX

1. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.
2. React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.
3. We split JSX over multiple lines for readability. While it isnâ€™t required, when doing this, we also recommend wrapping it in parentheses to avoid the pitfalls of automatic semicolon insertion.
4. After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.
5. By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. This helps prevent XSS (cross-site-scripting) attacks.
6. creatElement
```javascript
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);
```

```javascript
// Note: this structure is simplified
const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world'
  }
};
```
