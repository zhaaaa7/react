1. new components: UserInput and UserOutput

2. Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via props and display it there
Add state to the App component (=> the username) and pass the username to the UserOutput component
3. Add a method to manipulate the state (=> an event-handler method)
4. Pass the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and bind it to the input-change event. Add two-way-binding to your input (in UserInput) to also display the starting username
5. Add styling of your choice to your components/ elements in the components - both with inline styles and stylesheets
