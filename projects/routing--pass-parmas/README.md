1. Add Routes to load "Users" and "Courses" on different pages 
2. Add a simple navigation with two links => One leading to "Users", one leading to "Courses"
3. Make the courses in "Courses" clickable by adding a link and load the "Course" component in the place of "Courses" (without passing any data for now)
4. Pass the course ID to the "Course" page and output it there
5. Pass the course title to the "Course" page - pass it as query params and manually parse them
6. Load the "Course" component as a nested component of "Courses"
7. Add a 404 error page and render it for any unknown routes
8. Redirect requests to /all-courses to /courses (=> Your "Courses" page)
