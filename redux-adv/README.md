#### Redux dev tool:  https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension

```javascript
const composeEnhancers=window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ || compose; //fallback compose function


const store=createStore(rootReducer,composeEnhancers(applyMiddleware(logger,thunk)));
```
the secend param of createStore is enhancer, middleware can be an enhancer.

### Middleware: 
1. functions / code you hook into a process which then then gets executed as a part of the process without stopping it. Do something with the action before it reaches the reducer.
```javascript
//middleware, run the code in between the reducer
const logger = store => {
    //let the action to the reducer
    return next => {
        //modify the action
        return action => {
            //the middleware
            console.log('[Middleware] dispatching',action); //action can be changed here
            const result=next(action); // pass the unmodified action, let the action continue to the reducer
            console.log('[Middleware] next state',store.getState());
            return result;
        }
    }
};
```
2. applyMiddleware: loop through all middlewares

```javascript
const store=createStore(rootReducer,applyMiddleware(logger,thunk));
```

3.  thunk: https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk

thunk make it possible to return a funtion that dispatch an action inside an action itself. This helps to apply asynchronous dispatching, it can wait and dispatch action whenerver you make it.



### action creator
1. Run async code with action creators: a function that returns an action (object). 
2. thunk lets the action creator not return an action but a function which will then (asynchronously) dispatch another (normal, sync) action.

```javascript
//synchronous actionCreator
const saveResult=(res)=>{
    //const updatedResult=res*2;
    return {
        type:actionTypes.STORE_RESULT,
        result:res
    };
};

//asynchronous actionCreator
export const storeResult=(res)=>{
    return (dispatch,getState)=>{
        setTimeout(() => {
            //get the current state in central store
            const oldCounter=getState().ctr.counter;
            console.log(oldCounter);
            dispatch(saveResult(res));
        }, 2000);
    };
       
};
```

3. Use an index.js file to export all action creators
```javascript
export {add,subtract,increment,decrement} from './counter';

export {storeResult,deleteResult} from './result';
```

### other ...
1. Where to transform the data before reaching the store? 

-- Action creator or reducer? â€” probably reducer because it is designed to update the state

2. Use getState() or pass the state as a payload? 

-- Not too much logic in action creator.

3. Use an utility.js file for immutability and a clean switch statement.
```
javascript
export const updateObject=(oldObject,updatedValues)=>{
    return {
        ...oldObject,
        ...updatedValues, //expect an object
    };
};
```
